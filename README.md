## Self-Evaluation: 
(You may base this on the number of exercises you were able to complete)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 18/20. BUT I am turning it in late, so therefor I am unsure.

## Self-Reflection:
I learned a lot about arrays and how they work and some other smaller syntax things I hadn't learned before. I am new to JS this semester, so it is all a learning experience.

### How long it took you to finish this?
roughly 5-6 hours, with about a hour break in the middle.
